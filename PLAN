It should:

1. Be a single immediately executed function continuation
2. The state should look like:

type State = {

  // Constant, immutable data describing the application
  metadata: Metadata {
    Version: AppVersion,
    Revision: GitCommit,
    BuildTime: Timestamp,
  },

  // Application parameters
  params: Parameters {
    Tokens: [Token],
    Location: Location,
    History: History,
    Environment: EnvName,
    Features: [Feature],
  },

  // Currently Executed Action
  currentAction: Action,

  // Current Application State
  // (resulting from the current action and current parameters)
  state: {
    Index: PageIndex,
    CurrentCommand: Command,
  },

  // List of Combinators to produce the state
  combinators: [
    Index,
    Page,
  ],

  // List of Effects that will consume the state
  effects: [
    analytics,
    localStorage,
    render,
  ]

}

3. The actions to be triggered are:

* bootstrap: initialize
* search: trigger a search
