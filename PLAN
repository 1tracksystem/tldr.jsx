It should:

1. Be a single immediately executed function continuation
2. The state should look like:

type State = {

  // Constant, immutable data describing the application
  metadata: Metadata {
    Version: AppVersion,
    Revision: GitCommit,
    BuildTime: Timestamp,
  },

  // Mutable application parameters
  params: Parameters {
    Tokens: [Token],
    Location: Location,
    History: History,
    Environment: EnvName,
    Features: [Feature],
  },

  // The currently executed action
  currentAction: Action,

  // The current application state resulting from the current action
  // and current parameters
  state: {
    Index: PageIndex,
    CurrentCommand: Command,
  },

  // The list of combinators to produce the state
  combinators: [
    Index,
    Page,
  ],


  // The list of effects that will consume the state
  effects: [
    analytics,
    localStorage,
    render,
  ]

}

3. The actions to be triggered are:

* bootstrap: initialize
* search: trigger a search

Auxiliary events include:
* `search:begin`
* `search:end`
* `search:failure`
* `search:success`
