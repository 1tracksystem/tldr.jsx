### Collaboration Setup

It requires a working `node` environment with `npm`.

You can run any of these to get a build:

* `npm run-script build` for a release build, 
* `npm start`, for watching and rebuilding as you go

Serve locally as you wish, I preffer `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

It's clearly a work in progress, so there's many flaws, but PR's are more than welcomed! 

### Roadmap

As [tldr-pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) advances, new features can be planned. Some are:

* `IndexedDB cache`, allowing immediate access to a number of commands
* `Autocomplete/Suggest`, freeing you from remembering all those command names
* `Search`, letting you search through all the pages and commands to find what you want
